# SOLID Principles & Design Patterns — Learning Journey

Welcome! 👋  

This repository is my structured learning journey focused on writing clean, maintainable, and extensible code using **object-oriented design**, **SOLID principles**, and **design patterns**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Strengthen understanding of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** fundamentals.
- Master **SOLID principles** for robust class and module design.
- Learn and implement classic **design patterns** (creational, structural, behavioral).
- Prepare to design scalable systems using advanced architectural approaches.

---

## 🗺️ Learning Order & Topics

### 1️⃣ Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals

- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance vs composition
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

📁 Folder: `oop-fundamentals/`

---

### 2️⃣ SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** — One reason to change.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** — Open for extension, closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** — Subtypes should be substitutable for base types.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** — No client should depend on unused interfaces.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** — Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

### 4️⃣ Clean Architecture & Advanced Design (Future Scope)

- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- CQRS & Event-Driven Design
- Testing approaches in clean architectures
